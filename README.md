# MixoBioGeo

Scripts allowing the reproduction of results from Faure et al. 2018 (submitted).

All datasets needed to run the scripts are available at LIEN FIGSHARE. Each script is independant and produces different subtables from the same original data, hence they shall be launched one at a time.

MAPS produces Figure 1

BUBBLE produces Figure 2

STATS produces Figure 3

COLvsACANTH produces Figure 4
